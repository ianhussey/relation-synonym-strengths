## Overview and purpose

Determine which synonymns of true/false and causes/prevents can be categorised most quickly, and are therefore most suitable for inclusion in Relational Responding Task inducer trials. 

## Methods 

### Measures 

#### Categorisation tasks

Taken from first block of an IAT. Categorize the stimuli in the middle of the screen using the left and right response options and labels. 

8 exemplars per category, three blocks of 80 trials. Therefore 15 RTs per stimulus per participant.

Two tasks (causality synonyms and truth synonyms), presented in random order.

##### Causes

#### Truth synonyms categorisation task

### Sample

40 participants at £0.80 each (8 minute experiment).

## Hypotheses

H1: RTs will differ between synonyms within each category within each task, making some synonyms more automatic (faster) than others. 

H2: RTs will differ between categories within each task, making antonym asymmetrically automatic (faster) than others. 

## Analytic strategy

### Exclusions

#### Incomplete data

Participants with incomplete data will be excluded from the analysis.

#### Outliers

Reaction time outliers are defined as `mean rt ± 2.5 SD` within each task and will be excluded from the analysis.

### Analyses

By sampling the same number of trials for the same number of synonyms from each participant, we have procedurally controlled for differences in general responding speed between participants. 

Four one-way ANOVAs will be used to test for differences between the synonyms for each word  within each RRT (i.e., true, false, causes, prevents). For each task and synonym category, mean RT for each synonym will be be plotted with 95% CI. Synonymns for each word with the lowest RTs will be selected from visual inspection of the plots (e.g., small mean RT with narrow 95% CI).

Two Welch's independent t-test will also be used to assess whether, within each task, participants are faster to respond to one synonym category over the other (e.g., true vs. false, causes vs. prevents).
