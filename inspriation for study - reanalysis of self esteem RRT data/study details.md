## Overview, purpose and findings

Existing data from a self-esteem RRT study was used to extract RTs from block 1 (inducer trials only) to compare the RTs between exemplars. Full raw RRT data and procedure is not made available here; sufficient code to reproduce the inducer trials + the data from the inducer trials only.

Differences between exemplars were found. Furhtermore, RTs for all categories were higher than expected given the simplicity of the task. 

This raised the broad question of whether we can and should select synonyms that people can categorize relatively automatically for future RRT studies.

Because only 5 exemplars were included, a subselection within this was not possible - new data needed. Plus, these used dutch exemplars, where future studies will be done in english.
